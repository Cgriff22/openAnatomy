Welcome to openAnatomy!

openAnatomy is interactive educational tool for students of human anatomy. 

So far, openAnatomy primarily uses libraries like Google's mediapipe and opencv to track hand movement via camera
and overlay the anatomy of the hand. Students can use their index finger to point to any bone on either hand
to display its name along the top of the window. 

The plan is to expand this capability to include all of human anatomy. First order of business is to research what 
technologies exist that might enable the creation of such a thing, and to also explore limitations.

I already attempted to utilize 3D models but of course that is far too computationally intensive to be practical
for most learners. So, I switched to simpler two dimensional models.
